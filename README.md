Project Description:
This project explores the classification of handwritten digit images using neural networks and the effect of dimensionality reduction with Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The dataset consists of digit images organized into separate folders for training and testing, with each class representing a digit from 0 to 9. Images are preprocessed by resizing and extracting Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features, which capture essential shape information for classification. Three different neural network architectures are defined and trained: a simple feedforward network, a deeper network with more layers, and a network with dropout for regularization. The models are first trained and evaluated on the raw HOG features to establish baseline accuracy. Next, PCA is applied to reduce the feature dimensionality by 50%, and the same neural network architectures are retrained and tested on the transformed data. The project compares the test accuracies before and after applying PCA, revealing the trade-off between accuracy and dimensionality reduction. Results are documented in the file "accuracy.txt", highlighting how model performance changes with and without PCA. The project demonstrates practical aspects of feature extraction, neural network design, and the impact of PCA in a machine learning workflow. This approach provides insights into optimizing model performance and computational efficiency for image classification tasks.
